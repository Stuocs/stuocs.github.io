# Welcome to Kairos_0x.

I am **Stuocs** (Alfredo), a **System Administrator** based in Spain currently pivoting into **Offensive Security**.

**Kairos_0x** is my personal documentation project—a collection of CTF writeups, malware analysis research, and security methodologies.

My background is deeply rooted in infrastructure. I currently manage an enterprise Active Directory environment, including Domain Controllers, Fortinet firewalls, and MikroTik networking infrastructure. This hands-on experience allows me to identify architectural weaknesses that others might overlook.

My goal is to transition into a full-time role as a **Pentester** or **Cybersecurity Engineer**. I am currently preparing for my **OSCP** certification.
